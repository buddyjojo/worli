### Simple WoR on Linux Installer.

Built for simplicity and compatibility.

Unlike Botspot's wor-flasher that only works on Debian and is a bit bloated, this script is meant to be more simpler and work on any distro with bash (or potentially bash compatible, e.g. `zsh`), `wimlib`, `parted`, dosfstools and exfatprogs.

This script now supports macOS too! (macOS support is currently experimental, use the script in the repo's code section)
 
Also you can use your own ISO and even a modified install.wim*

*\* A modified install.wim still requires an iso for the boot.wim and boot files*

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Go to "Releases" and download the latest "worli.sh" or use this link: https://github.com/buddyjojo/worli/releases/latest/download/worli.sh

  > HELP WANTED: If you have a bit of spare time it would be nice if you try the script in the repo's code section and see if it works, if it does or any problem araises please create an issue or contact me on the discord server.

2. Put the script into a empty folder WITH NO SPACES IN ITS NAME!

3. Open the terminal in that folder and run `chmod +x worli.sh` and then `sudo ./worli.sh` or `sudo bash worli.sh` (in a root shell, just `./worli.sh` or `bash worli.sh`)

4. Follow the instructions the script gives
