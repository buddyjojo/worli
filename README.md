Simple WoR on Linux Installer.

Unlike Botspot's flasher that only works on Debian, this script is meant to be more simpler and work on any distro with bash (or potentially bash compatible}, wimlib, parted and ntfs support. 
 
Also you can use your own ISO and even an WIM*

*Custom WIM not recommended

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Go to the releases and download "worli.sh"

NOTE: I recommand you dont use the one in the repo files because it could be in a broken state.

2. Put the script into a empty folder WITH NO SPACES IN ITS NAME!

3. Open the terminal in that folder and run `sudo ./worli.sh` or `sudo bash worli.sh` (in a root shell, just `./worli.sh` or `bash worli.sh`)

4. Follow the instructions the script gives

If you have any problems or suggestions please create an issue.
