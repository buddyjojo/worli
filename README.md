# worli
simple wor on linux installer

unlike botspot's flasher that only works on Debian this script is meant to be more simpler and work on any distro with bash, wimlib and parted. 

instead of downloading files witch adds complexity and more things to go wrong this script requires you to download the needed files by yourself as directed.
 
also you can use your own iso and even an wim*

*custom wim not recommended
