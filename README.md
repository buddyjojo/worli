### Simple WoR on Linux Installer.

Built for simplicity and compatibility.

Unlike Botspot's flasher that only works on Debian, this script is meant to be more simpler and work on any distro with bash (or potentially bash compatible, e.g. `zsh`), `wimlib`, `parted`, and NTFS support (`mkfs.ntfs` command). 
 
Also you can use your own ISO and even a WIM*

*\* Custom WIM not recommended*

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Go to "Releases" and download the latest "worli.sh" or use this link: https://github.com/buddyjojo/worli/releases/latest

  > NOTE: It is not recommended to use the file in this repo's code section directly because it could be in a broken state.

2. Put the script into a empty folder WITH NO SPACES IN ITS NAME!

3. Open the terminal in that folder and run `chmod +x worli.sh` and then `sudo ./worli.sh` or `sudo bash worli.sh` (in a root shell, just `./worli.sh` or `bash worli.sh`)

4. Follow the instructions the script gives
