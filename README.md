# worli
simple wor on linux installer

unlike botspot's flasher that only works on Debian this script is meant to be more simpler and work on any distro with bash, wimlib, parted and ntfs support. 
 
also you can use your own iso and even an wim*

*custom wim not recommended

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. go to the releases and download "worli.sh"

2. put the script into a empty folder WITH NO SPACES IN ITS NAME!

3. open the terminal in that folder and run "sudo ./worli.sh" (or just ./worli.sh in a root shell)

4. follow the instructions the script gives

if you have any problems or suggestions please create a issue.
